Using Python and Tweepy to gather The Plague NFT Twitter Like and Retweet Data in order to facilitate minting whitelist.

## What I did

I wrote some loops so The Plague NFT could pull user engagement data from their tweets during their whitelist giveaway process.

The founder was able to see which users were engaged with their tweets and to what degree.

This helped them select users to add to the whitelist.

## Web App Version

I turned it into a web app so anyone can use it.
Enter a Tweet, and it will return a list of users who liked or retweeted it.
Then you can export the data to a CSV file.
